What are some things we’ve learned from fine scale, granular-data studies?

What are some things we’ve learned from macroscale, aggregated-data studies?

## Research Question(s)
\small

\textbf{1. Are more granular measures of Ag activity related to lake water quality (TN, TP) across hundreds of lakes and their watersheds?}

\vspace{1em}

\textbf{2. Do relationships between Ag activities and lake water quality vary spatially among hydrologic and climatic regions?}

Our study lakes are more often eutrophic relative to lakes in general.

## Methods - Statistical modelling
\small

\alert{Build a multivariate model to explain nutrients in lakes} that is:

\vspace{1em}

1\. Informative - Allows for interpretation of variable importance

> All predictors were treated as global (fixed) effects except for watershed land-use which was treated as spatially varying.

> Model selection by leave-one-out cross validation to arrive at the "best" watershed land use predictor.

## Methods - Regression Modelling
\small

<!-- Choose random effect variable(s) that we expect to vary regionally. -->

\alert{Watershed land use is a proxy} for many different specific activities which are likely to be regionally variable. \par \vspace{-1em}\tiny[@burcherLANDCOVERCASCADERELATIONSHIPS2007]\small

<!-- Evaluate spatial variation in the relationships between lake nutrients and Ag proxies. -->

<!-- ### Assumption 2 -->

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=11cm]{../../JournalSubmissions/lagos_ag/figures/02_hierarchical_demo-1.png}
  \end{figure}

<!-- Therefore, \alert{we modelled the relationship between land use variables and lake nutrients as spatially variable}.  -->

<!-- Spatial random effects estimates are weighted by sample size. -->
<!-- \vspace{1em} -->

## Methods - Statistical modelling
\small

\alert{Build a multivariate model to explain nutrients in lakes} that is:

\vspace{1em}

2\. Reliable - Provides an estimate of parameter uncertainity

> Fit model in a Bayesian framework where predictor coefficients are given "horseshoe" priors.

[**Image of a horseshoe prior?**]

<!-- ## Methods - Mixed modelling -->
<!-- \small -->

<!-- \textbf{One variable from each predictor category was treated as a global (fixed) effect} -->

<!-- \alert{For TP}, this was Buffer Ag, P fertilizer input, Baseflow, and Max depth. -->

<!-- \alert{For TN}, this was Buffer Ag, N fertilizer input, Soil organic carbon, and Max depth. -->

<!-- \textbf{Watershed land-use cover was treated as a spatially varying (random) effect} -->

<!-- \alert{For TN, TP}, this was one of Ag, Pasture, Corn, Soybeans, etc. -->

<!-- Many of the variables within predictor categories are related. -->

<!-- Choose fixed effect variables based on the single strongest relationship from the prior correlation analysis. -->

<!-- to intrepret the relative influence of each _category_ of predictors. -->

<!-- \vspace{1em} -->

<!-- [**figure**] -->

<!-- Therefore, \alert{we modelled a global relationship between most variables and lake nutrients}. -->

<!-- [**Cartoon model descriptions**] -->

<!-- Why are proxy variables used for spatial random effects? -->

<!-- Which variables were assigned to each category? -->

<!-- Modelling justification from Collins XXXX as well as Filstrup 2018. -->

## Results - TP Model 
\small

Several fixed effect coefficients like Baseflow and Max depth had a strong influence on predicted TP concentrations.
<!-- Fixed effect coefficients were markedly different among predictor categories. -->
<!-- # Note how different in magnitude baseflow and max depth are from the others. 
A one sd change in either will have a large effect on the fitted value -->

No evidence for spatial variation in the relationship between watershed Ag land use and TP.

## Results - TN Model 
\small

Few fixed effect coefficients had a strong influence on predicted TN concentrations.

Several regions appear to be more sensitive to watershed corn land use cover.

\end{columns}

## Results - TN Model
\small

Regions that are Ag sensitive appear to have lower soil clay content, higher N deposition, and lower TP concentrations.

## Discussion
\small

Lake TN in highlighted regions may be more sensitive to Ag because:
\vspace{2em}

Fields in these regions have more direct drainage due to higher prevalence of wetland soils.

Lakes in these regions are P limited so excess TN accumulates in the water column \tiny[@filstrupRelationshipChlorophyllPhosphorus2017]\small

Lakes in these regions are less hypereutrophic \tiny[@wagnerLandscapeDriversRegional2011]\small
<!-- 18 percent vs 12 percent (jsta calculated) -->
<!-- TN not lower in these regions but still ... -->

Lakes in these regions are affected by an interaction among multiple land use types.



## Conclusions
\small

\textbf{1. Are more granular measures of Ag activity related to lake water quality (TN, TP) across hundreds of lakes and their watersheds?}

> Both lake TP and lake TN were related to granular measures of Ag activity.

> Lake TN concentration was related to watershed corn cover and riparian buffer composition.

\vspace{-0.5em}

\textbf{2. Do relationships between Ag activities and lake water quality vary spatially among hydrologic and climatic regions?}

> The relationship between lake TN and land-use cover was spatially variable. 

<!-- This variability may be related to differences in lake TP, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, or soil clay content. -->

<!-- Lake TP was most strongly related to Non-ag and transport variables like lake depth and baseflow.  -->

<!-- Lake TP is well described by a global model not accounting for inter-regional variation in predictor relationships. -->

<!-- The Lake TN models using Corn as a primary landuse variable had higher predictive accuracy than models using row crop cover. -->
