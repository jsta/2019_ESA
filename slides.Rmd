## Introduction
\small

\alert{Ag land-use is associated with} increased nutrient loading to lakes and \alert{higher nutrient concentrations}.

## Background
\small

\alert{Ag land-use is an aggregated measure} that may mask underlying relationships.

## Research Question(s)
\small

\textbf{Are more granular measures of Ag activity related to lake water quality across hundreds of lakes and their watersheds?}

## Results - Correlation analysis
\small

\alert{Lake phosphorus concentrations} were most strongly associated with \alert{lake characteristics and measures of watershed nutrient transport}.

\alert{Lake nitrogen concentrations} were most strongly associated with \alert{agricultural land use and the composition of riparian buffers}.

## Methods - Regression Modelling
\small

<!-- ### Assumption 1 -->

The relationship of most variables to lake nutrients does not depend on location (citations).

[**figure**]

Therefore, \alert{we modelled a global relationship between most variables and lake nutrients}.

<!-- [**Cartoon model descriptions**] -->

<!-- Why are proxy variables used for spatial random effects? -->

<!-- Which variables were assigned to each category? -->

<!-- Modelling justification from Collins XXXX as well as Filstrup 2018. -->

## Methods - Analytical
\small

<!-- ### Assumption 2 -->

Ag land use is a proxy many different specific activities which are likely to be regionally variable (citations).

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=11cm]{../../JournalSubmissions/lagos_ag/figures/02_hierarchical_demo-1.png}
  \end{figure}

Therefore, \alert{we modelled the relationship between land use variables and lake nutrients as spatially variable}. 

<!-- Spatial random effects estimates are weighted by sample size. -->
<!-- \vspace{1em} -->

## Results - Analytical - TP Model 
\small

Fixed effect coefficients were markedly different among predictor categories.

Spatial random effects cleanly capture additional variation.

  \end{figure}
  
## Results - Analytical - TN Model 
\small

Fixed effect coefficients similar among predictor categories.

Specific regions have markedly different spatial random effect slopes.

  \end{figure}
  
## Results - Analytical - TN Model
\small

Lake TN in highlighted regions is more sensitive to Ag relative to other regions.

\end{columns}
  
## Discussion
\small

Lake TN in highlighted regions are more sensitive to Ag because:
\vspace{2em}

They are less often hypereutrophic \tiny[@wagnerLandscapeDriversRegional2011]\small
<!-- 18 percent vs 12 percent -->

\textbf{or}

TN is not incorporated into biomass due to P limitation \tiny[@filstrupRelationshipChlorophyllPhosphorus2017]\small


## Conclusions
\small

<!-- Both lake TP and lake TN are related to granular measures of Ag activity.  -->

Lake TP driven by Non-ag and transport variables while TN driven by nutrient sources (cite Collins et al. 2017)

Lake TN models using Corn as a primary landuse variable had higher predictive accuracy than models using row crop cover.

Lake TP is strongly related to lake depth and stream buffer composition but has little regional spatial patterning.

Lake TN has marked regional spatial patterning that appear to be related to atmospheric nitrogen deposition and soil clay content.
