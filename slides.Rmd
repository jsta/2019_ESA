## Introduction
\small

## Background

## Research Question(s)
\small

\textbf{Are more granular measures of Ag activity related to lake water quality across hundreds of lakes and their watersheds?}

## Methods - Correlation analysis
\small

Exploratory analysis to determine how lake nutrients are related to predictors from each category.

## Results - Correlation analysis
\small

\alert{Lake phosphorus concentrations} were most strongly associated with \alert{lake characteristics and measures of watershed nutrient transport}.

\vspace{0.5em}

\alert{Lake nitrogen concentrations} were most strongly associated with \alert{agricultural land use and the composition of riparian buffers}.

## Methods - Regression Modelling
\small

Intrepret the relative influence of each "category" of predictors.

Choose the single strongest relationship from the correlation analysis.

\vspace{1em}

\alert{For TP}, this is Buffer Ag, P fertilizer input, Baseflow, and Max depth.

\alert{For TN}, this is Buffer Ag, N fertilizer input, Soil organic carbon, and Max depth.

<!-- Therefore, \alert{we modelled a global relationship between most variables and lake nutrients}. -->

<!-- Why are proxy variables used for spatial random effects? -->

<!-- Which variables were assigned to each category? -->

<!-- Modelling justification from Collins XXXX as well as Filstrup 2018. -->

## Methods - Regression Modelling
\small

Evaluate spatial variation in the relationships between lake nutrients and Ag proxies.

Ag land use is a proxy for many different specific activities which are likely to be regionally variable \tiny[@falconeRegionalPatternsAnthropogenic2019]\small.

<!-- ### Assumption 2 -->



\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=11cm]{../../JournalSubmissions/lagos_ag/figures/02_hierarchical_demo-1.png}
  \end{figure}

Therefore, \alert{we modelled the relationship between land use variables and lake nutrients as spatially variable}. 

<!-- Spatial random effects estimates are weighted by sample size. -->
<!-- \vspace{1em} -->

## Results - TP Model 
\small

Fixed effect coefficients were markedly different among predictor categories.

Spatial random effects cleanly capture additional variation.

  \end{figure}
  
## Results - TN Model 
\small

Fixed effect coefficients similar among predictor categories.

Specific regions have markedly different spatial random effect slopes.

  \end{figure}
  
## Results - TN Model
\small

Lake TN in highlighted regions is more sensitive to Ag relative to other regions.

\end{columns}
  
## Discussion
\small

Lake TN in highlighted regions may more sensitive to Ag because:
\vspace{2em}

Lakes in these regions are less hypereutrophic \tiny[@wagnerLandscapeDriversRegional2011]\small
<!-- 18 percent vs 12 percent -->

Lakes in these regions are P limited, excess TN accumulates in the water column \tiny[@filstrupRelationshipChlorophyllPhosphorus2017]\small


## Conclusions
\small

<!-- Both lake TP and lake TN are related to granular measures of Ag activity.  -->

Lake TP was most strongly related to Non-ag and transport variables like lake depth and baseflow. 

Lake TP is well described by a global model not accounting for inter-regional variation in predictor relationships.

\vspace{1em}

Lake TN models were particularly improved by more granular Ag information (Corn cover, riparian buffer composition). 
<!-- The Lake TN models using Corn as a primary landuse variable had higher predictive accuracy than models using row crop cover. -->

<!-- \tiny \small (cite Collins et al. 2017) -->

Lake TN is well described by a hierarchical model where relationships with land use are allowed to vary among regions. 

Regional differences may be related to lake TP, atmospheric nitrogen deposition, or soil clay content.
