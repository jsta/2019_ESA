## Introduction

Ag land-use is associated with increased nutrient loading to lakes and higher nutrient concentrations.

## Background

Ag land-use is an aggregated measure that may mask underlying relationships.

## Research Question(s)

Are more granular measures of Ag activity related to lake water quality across hundreds of lakes and their watersheds?

## Methods

Measures of Ag activity include:

 * Direct measures of nutrient inputs

 * Indirect measures of nutrient inputs (proxies)
 
 * Spatial arrangment of Ag activity (stream buffer composition)
