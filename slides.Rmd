## Introduction

Ag land-use is associated with increased nutrient loading to lakes and higher nutrient concentrations.

 [**NLCD vs TP/TN figure**]

## Background

Ag land-use is an aggregated measure that may mask underlying relationships.

[**NLCD vs CDL figure**]

## Research Question(s)

Are more granular measures of Ag activity related to lake water quality across hundreds of lakes and their watersheds?
